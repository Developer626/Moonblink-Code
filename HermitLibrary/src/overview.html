<p><b>HermitLibrary</b> is a collection of useful classes for
geodetic, astronomical and other types of calculation, in a generic
Java library which can be used on any OS.  It has been used by me
mainly on Android, but I've deliberately kept any dependency on
Android out of the code.</p>

<p>For information on getting the code, see
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/moonblink/wiki/HermitLibrary">the
project home page on Google Code</a>.
