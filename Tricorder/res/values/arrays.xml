<item><b>Tricorder</b> displays real data from the sensors built into
your device.\n\
\n\
The following sections describe how to use Tricorder, and how to interpret
the displays.  For further information, see the \"About\" box, which contains
a link to the project home page.</item>

<item>The main controls in Tricorder are the buttons down the left hand side
of the screen.  These allow you to select between the available data views
(see \"Views\" below).  Additionally, some views have their own controls:\n\
\n\
In the <b>GRAV</b> and <b>MAG</b> views:\n\
• touch the \"SCAN\" button at the top-right to start and stop scanning
(except in continuous mode; see \"Settings\").\n\
• touch the X/Y axis plot to switch between absolute and relative modes.\n\
• touch the numeric data display to toggle it to an X/Y/Z graph plot.\n\
\n\
The <b>ACO</b> view is controlled through settings.\n\
\n\
In the <b>GEO</b> view, touch the satellite display to change its mode.\n\
\n\
In the <b>EMS</b> view, touch the \"WiFi Pwr\" button at the top-right to
turn the WiFi on and off.\n\
\n\
In the <b>SOL</b> view, touch the \"Mode Alt\" button at the top-right
to display different information; tap the Sun image to see different Sun
views.\n\
\n\
More detail on controls within the views is provided in their help
sections below.</item>

<item>Tricorder has multiple views, which you can switch between
using the buttons on the left.  Each view displays a particular type of
information, as detailed in the sections below.  All views have the stardate
in the top-left corner (notated as per the J.J. Abrams move).</item>

<item>@array/help_screens_texts</item>

<item>The device\'s \"menu\" button pops up a menu containing a number
of options:\n\
• <b>Settings</b> takes you to the settings screen; see \"Settings\" below.\n\
• <b>Help</b> displays this help.\n\
• <b>About</b> displays an about box, with links to the license and
the project home page.\n\
• <b>Exit</b> stops the Tricorder application.</item>

<item>Tricorder has a number of user-configurable options in its Settings
screen.  This screen is reached through the menu, as described under \"Menu\"
above.  The available settings are detailed in the following sections.</item>

<item>@array/help_prefs_texts</item>

<item>Note that the availability and accuracy of the information
presented depends on the underlying hardware.  In particular the magnetic
field data is known to be unreliable on some currently available devices,
and the gravity reading can be affected by any vibration, including
playing music.</item>

<item><b>GRAV</b> shows the local gravitational field.  To start scanning
and displaying data, touch the \"SCAN\" button at the top-right; touch it
again to stop (except in continuous mode; see \"Settings\").\n\
\n\
The display shows the individual field
components on an X/Y plot and a vertical gauge for the Z axis.  Additionally
an altitude gauge shows the angle above or below the tricorder\'s horizontal
plane.  The scale lines show multiples of 1g.  Note that gravity is equivalent
to an upwards acceleration; Tricorder shows the direction of this
acceleration.\n\
\n\
Below this the absolute magnitude of the gravitational field
is graphed.  Again, the scale lines show multiples of 1g.  The graph
automatically adjusts to show the range of measured values.\n\
\n\
The third section displays the raw numeric data: \"X\", \"Y\"
and \"Z\" are the acceleration values in each of the three dimensions, in
m/s²; \"Az\" is the direction of the gravitational field in the X-Y
plane, in degrees relative to the top of the device; \"Alt\" is the elevation
of the acceleration above or below the horizontal, in degrees; and \"Mag\"
is the absolute magnitude of the gravitational field, in m/s².  When this
becomes zero, you are in free fall.\n\
\n\
You can touch the X/Y axis plot to switch between absolute and relative modes.
When you enter relative mode, the current values are stored; the plot
starts displaying changes relative to those values.\n\
\n\
Touch the numeric data display to toggle it to an X/Y/Z graph plot; red
is X, green is Y, and blue is Z.</item>

<item><b>MAG</b> shows the local magnetic field.  To start scanning
and displaying data, touch the \"SCAN\" button at the top-right; touch it
again to stop (except in continuous mode; see \"Settings\").\n\
\n\
The display shows the individual magnetic field
components on an X/Y plot and a vertical gauge for the Z axis.  Additionally
an altitude gauge shows the angle above or below the tricorder\'s horizontal
plane.  The scale lines show multiples of 60 micro-tesla, the maximum
magnetic field on Earth\'s surface.  The X-Y plot
can be used like a compass; keep the altitude at zero to see exactly which
way the magnetic field is pointing.\n\
\n\
Below this the absolute magnitude of the magnetic field is graphed.  Again,
the scale lines show multiples of 60 micro-tesla.  The graph
automatically adjusts to show the range of measured values.\n\
\n\
The third section displays the raw numeric data: \"X\", \"Y\"
and \"Z\" are the field values in each of the three dimensions, in
micro-tesla; \"Az\" is the direction of the magnetic field in the X-Y
plane, in degrees relative to the top of the device; \"Alt\" is the elevation
of the field above or below the horizontal, in degrees; and \"Mag\"
is the absolute magnitude of the magnetic field, in micro-tesla.\n\
\n\
You can touch the X/Y axis plot to switch between absolute and relative modes.
When you enter relative mode, the current values are stored; the plot
starts displaying changes relative to those values.\n\
\n\
Touch the numeric data display to toggle it to an X/Y/Z graph plot; red
is X, green is Y, and blue is Z.\n\
</item>
    
<item><b>ACO</b> displays an analysis of the local acoustic environment.  The
first section shows a waveform display of the sound picked up by the
microphone; this display auto-scales to handle a wide range of sound levels.\n\
\n\
Below this a frequency spectrum is displayed.  The horizontal scale shows the
frequencies displayed; the maximum frequency will depend on the selected
sampling rate (see \"Settings\").  The vertical scale is logarithmic, with
a range from -60dB to 0dB.  Scale lines are drawn every 10dB.\n\
\n\
The third section displays the absolute power level of the sound as received
by the device\'s microphone.  This is displayed as decibels (dB) relative
to the maximum possible input from the microphone; so
0dB is the maximum the device can register, -10dB is 1/10th of this, -20dB
is 1/100th of the max, etc.  Each 10 dB multiplies or divides the level by 10.
The power meter also shows peak markers, and
a background bar displays a rolling average.  The rolling average is also
displayed numerically.</item>

<item><b>GEO</b> shows geographic information from the various providers which
your device has.  \"Network\" displays location from the cellular phone or
WiFi network; \"GPS\" is the reported GPS location, if GPS is enabled.
Locations are shown in latitude and longitude degrees and minutes, with
fractional minutes.  \"Alt\" is the altitude, and \"Acc\" is the estimated
accuracy of the fix.  If the location provider provides course data,
then \"Head\" is the direction you are moving in, and \"Spd\" is your
speed.  Distances and speeds are shown in your selected units; see
\"Settings\".\n\
\n\
The latest available fix data, if there is any, will always be displayed.
Note that this data may be old.  The data is coloured to indicate its
age, and the age is also shown in the header bar for each location
provider.\n\
\n\
Below these an indication of the satellites in view is displayed; tap it to
toggle between a sky diagram and signal strength bars.  The sky diagram also
indicates true north, with magnetic north drawn as a narrower arrow over
it.  Note that the accuracy of the north indication depends on your device\'s
magnetometer, which can be very poor.</item>

<item><b>EMS</b> scans the electromagnetic spectrum for
radio signals (as supported by hardware).  Detected signals are shown
as strength bars and a numeric strength indicator -- zero is no signal
(or too weak to be useful); 31 is maximum for cellular, and 41 seems to be
maximum for WiFi.  At the top-right corner you
will see a \"WiFi Pwr\" button which turns the WiFi on and off.\n\
\n\
For cellular, we display the cell ID, the network provider, and the
signal strength above the strength bar.  For WiFi networks, we display
the frequency in GHz, access mode, network ID, and signal
strength.  The access mode is blank for an open access point;
\'!\' for an ad-hoc network (beware!); \'*\' for WEP encryption;
\'#\' for WPA encryption; \'?\' for unknown.  The WiFi data
is refreshed periodically; the age of the displayed WiFi data is shown
in the WiFi header bar.\n\
\n\
In the preferences you can enable WiFi ping.  With this on, the device
will ping after each WiFi network scan; an echo ping
indicates the strength of the strongest detected signal.  (No echo means
no detected WiFi.)</item>

<item><b>SOL</b> displays information on the state of the Sun and solar wind.
This information is downloaded from the internet, and it\'s downloaded
as a very low-priority task so as not to affect your device\'s performance.
Hence, it may take some time for the information to actually appear.
At the top-right corner you will see a \"Mode Alt\" button
to toggle between two different display modes.\n\
\n\
The \'Protons\' graph displays low- (blue), medium- (yellow), and high-
(red) energy protons; the \'Electrons\' graph displays low- (blue) and high-
(red) energy electrons.  The \'Spots,Flares\' graph displays the numbers
of sunspots (red), optical flares (blue), and X-ray flares (purple).  The
Sun image shows images of the Sun in different wavelengths of light; tap it
to step through the available images.\n\
\n\
The Sun images are downloaded directly from SOHO.  If you see banner text
on the image, like \"CCD Bakeout\", this generally indicates that images
are unavailable as the satellite is doing a maintenance routine on the
camera.  Google \"CCD Bakeout\" for more (it\'s interesting).</item>

<item><b>Scan continuously</b> tells the GRAV and MAG views to scan
all the time that they are displayed.  In this mode, the \"SCAN\" button
no longer appears in those views.  Also, the scanning sound does not play.</item>

<item><b>Sound level</b> adjusts the base volume of Tricorder\'s sound
effects: off, quiet, or normal.  The actual volume level is controlled
by the device\'s \"Media Volume\" setting; inside Tricorder,
the hardware volume keys can be used to adjust this.\n\
\n\
<b>Scanning sound</b> turns the scanning sound in the GRAV and MAG views
on or off.  Note that the scanning sound does not play in continuous
scanning mode (see above).\n\
\n\
<b>WiFi ping</b> turns the WiFi ping mode on or off.  When enabled,
in the EMS screen an audible ping will be used to indicate the strength
of the strongest available WiFi signal.</item>

<item><b>Data units</b> allows you to select your preferred units for the
display of common physical measures such as distance and speed.\n\
\n\
<b>Screen orientation</b> determines whether and how Tricorder will
switch its display between portrait and landscape:\n\
• <b>System default</b> -- the system will determine the orientation based
on the task context.\n\
• <b>Portrait</b> -- lock to portrait mode.\n\
• <b>Landscape</b> -- lock to landscape mode.\n\
• <b>User preference</b> -- Tricorder will switch orientation according to
the global device settings.\n\
• <b>Device orientation</b> -- follow the physical orientation of the device.\n\
\n\
<b>Keep device awake</b> tells the application to keep the screen active
until you manually leave the application.  This is useful if you want
to set Tricorder up to continually display data over a long
period; however, be aware that it will quickly drain your battery.</item>

<item><b>Sample rate</b> sets the audio sampling rate in samples/second.  A
higher rate will require more processing power.  The
frequency range of the spectrum analyser is half the sample rate;
this frequency range is displayed alongside the sample rate.\n\
\n\
<b>Block size</b> sets the size in samples of the data block processed
by the spectrum analyser.  A larger block size provides finer frequency
resolution; the number of frequency bars is half the block size.  However,
a larger block size introduces more delay and requires significantly more
processing power.\n\
\n\
<b>Window function</b> sets the spectrum analyser windowing function.
Windowing eliminates spurious frequencies caused by the blocking of
the input, at the cost of making peaks a little wider.  Blackman-Harris is
a good bet.\n\
\n\
<b>Decimation</b> reduces the processing workload by only analysing a subset
of the input data blocks.\n\
\n\
<b>Histogram averaging</b> sets the averaging interval of the spectrum analyser.
\"None\" tells it to display instantaneous values; \"Fast\" displays the rolling
average over a few samples; and \"Slow\" displays a longer-term rolling
average.</item>
